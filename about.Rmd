I am biogeographer and ecological modeler currently doing a PhD in Ecology and Global Change, I have a Master in Ecology and Evolution, a Degree in Ecology, and quite a bit of experience in applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand the processes shaping the distribution of biodiversity across space and time.

My research activity is structured around four main lines, namely biogeography, Geographical Information Systems, range shift, and biodiversity conservation.
