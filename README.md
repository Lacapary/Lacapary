**I am global change ecologist and biogeographer currently studying biodiversity lag responses to climate change at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG). 
Since 2019 I have been developing my skills in data wrangling, statistical analysis, model development and data visualization.**
