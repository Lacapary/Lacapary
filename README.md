**I am global change ecologist and biogeographer currently studying biodiversity lag responses to climate change and how functional plant diversity has been affected by climatic changes at the [EDGE LAB](https://edge-ecology.com/) at the University of Gothenburg.
Since 2019 I have been developing my skills in data wrangling, statistical analysis, model development, and data visualization.**
